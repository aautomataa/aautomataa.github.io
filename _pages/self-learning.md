<!-- * Oct-Dec 2024: Implementation of Forward Collision Speed Warning System Based on YOLOv10 and DeepSORT
  * Independent Project / Advisor: Associate Prof. Ge Song, School of Computer and Electronic Information / Artificial Intelligence, NNU
  * Designed and implemented a forward collision warning system for autonomous driving using
YOLOv10(state-of-the-art object detection) and DeepSORT(object tracking), achieving real-time
detection and tracking of vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, buses) and calculating collision risks based on
distance, relative speed, and human reaction time. -->
