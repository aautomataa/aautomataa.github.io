excerpt: 'As the third author, I contributed to data preprocessing for five HAR datasets (UCI-HAR, PAMAP2, UNIMB-SHAR, WISDM, OPPORTUNITY), implemented comparative experiments using seven deep learning models (CNN, DCN, LSTM, MobileNet,
ResNet, Vit, STN), and authored the experimental setup and dataset description sections of the paper.'

* The main content of our paper is:
  * Proposed an adaptive solution of Dynamic Gaussian Convolution (DGConv), which can adaptively learn the optimal kernel size of sensor data in each convolutional layer without human intervention.  
  * Evaluated the performance of DGConv on embedded platforms and the accuracy and F1 score were 1.12% and 1.15% higher than those of the original CNN with the same parameters and ResNet of the same size without increasing additional inference time.  

* I am the third author of this paper. In this project, my contributions included:
  * Conducted data preprocessing for five HAR datasets (UCI-HAR, PAMAP2, UNIMB-SHAR, WISDM, OPPORTUNITY).  
  * Implemented the comparison experiment: realized comparison algorithms (CNN, DCN, LSTM, MobileNet, ResNet, Vit, STN) and adapted them to the five HAR datasets, a total of approximately 500 lines of code.
  * Completed the writing parts of the paper (experimental settings including Network Architecture, Training Settings, Evaluation Metrics and detailed description of five main HAR datasets used).
